# 🛒 E-Commerce Backend & Product Catalog – ProDev Project

## 👨‍💻 Full-Stack Participation – Backend & Frontend

I have **actively participated in both the Backend and Frontend tracks** of the **ProDev Engineering Program**, selecting the **E-Commerce Platform Creation** as my capstone project. This dual-role experience gave me hands-on exposure to full-stack development — from designing scalable APIs and secure authentication systems to building responsive, user-centric product catalogs on the frontend.

This repository captures my learnings, implementations, and collaboration as a full-stack developer in a real-world simulation setting.

## 🔧 Backend – E-Commerce API (`ProDev BE`)

### 🎯 Objective

To build a secure, scalable, and high-performance backend system for managing products, categories, and users, complete with API integrations and database optimizations.

### 🚀 Project Goals

- **CRUD APIs**: For products, categories, and user authentication.
- **Filtering, Sorting, Pagination**: For efficient product discovery.
- **Database Optimization**: Design relational schemas and index optimization.

### 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Django
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **API Documentation**: Swagger / OpenAPI

### ✅ Key Features

1. **CRUD Operations**
   - Manage products and categories.
   - User authentication with JWT.

2. **API Features**
   - Filter by category, sort by price.
   - Paginate large product lists.

3. **API Documentation**
   - Documented using Swagger or Postman for easy frontend consumption.

### ⚙️ Git Commit Workflow (Backend)

```bash
feat: set up Django project with PostgreSQL
feat: implement user authentication with JWT
feat: add product APIs with filtering and pagination
feat: integrate Swagger documentation for API endpoints
perf: optimize database queries with indexing
docs: add API usage instructions in Swagger
````

### 📦 Deployment

* APIs hosted with documentation published via Swagger/Postman.

## 💻 Frontend – Product Catalog UI (`ProDev FE`)

### 🎯 Objective

To develop a dynamic and responsive product catalog using modern frontend technologies that ensures performance, accessibility, and seamless UX.

### 🚀 Project Goals

* **API Integration**: Fetch and display products from the backend.
* **User Convenience**: Filtering and sorting products.
* **Enhanced UX**: Responsive UI, infinite scroll, and mobile-first design.

### 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Framework**: React / React Native
* **Language**: TypeScript
* **State Management**: Redux
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

### ✅ Key Features

1. **API Integration**

   * Display live data from backend APIs with loading/error states.

2. **Filtering and Sorting**

   * Filter by category and sort by price.
   * Combine multiple filters for better results.

3. **Pagination & Infinite Scrolling**

   * Choose between paginated or infinite loading for scalability.

4. **Responsive Design**

   * Fully mobile-optimized layout using Tailwind CSS.

### ⚙️ Git Commit Workflow (Frontend)

```bash
feat: set up project structure with React and TypeScript
feat: add API integration for fetching product data
feat: implement product filtering and sorting functionality
feat: add pagination and infinite scrolling
style: enhance UI with Tailwind CSS
fix: resolve bug in filtering logic
docs: update README with project setup and features
```

### 📦 Deployment

* Hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for public access.
